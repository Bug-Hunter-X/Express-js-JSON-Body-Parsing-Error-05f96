This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the JSON body parsing middleware fails to correctly handle empty or malformed JSON requests. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The solution involves using a more robust approach to handle potential errors and ensure the application gracefully processes requests with invalid JSON data.
